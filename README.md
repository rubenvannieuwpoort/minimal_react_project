# Minimal React project

This is an (almost) minimal self-contained React project. Besides `react` and `react-dom`, the only dependency is `esbuild`, which is necessary to have JSX support.

To run the app in a local development web server:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Or the `yarn` equivalent:
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
